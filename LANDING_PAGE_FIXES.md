# GSHA 2025 Landing Page - Missing Elements Fixed

## ðŸ”§ Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. **Typing Animation Not Working**

**Problem**: The typing animation wasn't triggering the `onComplete` callback properly, causing subsequent elements to remain hidden.

**Fix**:

- Simplified state management in `TypingAnimation.tsx`
- Added proper timeout for `onComplete` callback
- Fixed cursor rendering and blinking behavior
- Added fallback display for when animation is disabled

### 2. **Hidden Elements Due to Conditional Rendering**

**Problem**: Many elements were wrapped in `AnimatePresence` with conditions that prevented them from showing.

**Fix**:

- Removed unnecessary `AnimatePresence` wrappers
- Changed conditional opacity instead of conditional rendering
- Elements now animate in but are always present in DOM

### 3. **Navigation Not Appearing**

**Problem**: Navigation was hidden by default and only showed after IGNITE button click.

**Fix**:

- Changed `showNavigation` default state to `true`
- Navigation now appears automatically after page load
- Adjusted positioning to `35vh` from top for better visibility

### 4. **Logo Animation Issues**

**Problem**: Window references were causing server-side rendering issues and logos weren't animating properly.

**Fix**:

- Added proper window existence checks (`typeof window !== 'undefined'`)
- Provided fallback values for server-side rendering
- Fixed logo positioning for both desktop and mobile

### 5. **Button States Not Updating**

**Problem**: IGNITE button wasn't showing due to state chain dependencies.

**Fix**:

- Simplified state dependencies
- Button now shows immediately after typing completes
- Added proper flame burst animation on click

### 6. **Missing Headlines**

**Problem**: Main headlines weren't appearing due to cascading state issues.

**Fix**:

- Headlines now show automatically after button appears
- Improved text shadow animations
- Added responsive font sizing
