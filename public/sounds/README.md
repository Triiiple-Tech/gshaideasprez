# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files for the GSHA 2025 experience:

- `click.mp3` - Button click sound
- `spark.mp3` - Spark interaction sound
- `ember.mp3` - Ember floating sound
- `ignite.mp3` - Main ignite button sound
- `ambient.mp3` - Background ambient sound

All sounds are optional and the experience will work without them. The sound system is muted by default for better user experience and accessibility.

## File Requirements

- Format: MP3 (recommended) or OGG
- Size: Keep files under 100KB each for performance
- Volume: Pre-normalized to prevent sudden loud sounds
- Length: Short sounds (0.5-2 seconds), ambient can be longer and should loop seamlessly

## Accessibility

- Sounds respect the user's "prefers-reduced-motion" setting
- Muted by default
- Can be toggled on/off via the sound control button
- All functionality works perfectly without sound
